\textbf{Release note 2.3 (Changes to version 2.2)} \\

The focus of version 2.3 is on document management as well as on using CUBE PA for execution projects in the construction field. The essential new functionalities are:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Introduction of a document cart similar to a shopping cart in an online shop. The document cart offers many functionalities such as downloading several documents as a ZIP archive, sending them directly by e-mail, and sending them for printing.
	\item Directly sending e-mails with document attachments from CUBE PA. Sending documents is saved in the document log for transparency and traceability.
	\item Transmission of plans to plot centers for delivery of printed plans. Several plans can be sent to different recipients with one order. The execution is carried out separately for each recipient (number of copies, printed/electronic versions).
	\item Hierarchic tag structure: Document tags can now be used similarly to folder classification. This allows an optimal combined usage of the advantages of both classification types 'tags' and 'folders'. Documents can be found through one or more tags as well as by navigating the hierarchical document management structure. The same document can be classified and found in several 'hierarchic trees'.
\end{compactitem}

	\item \textbf{User management:} Hints to the functions of the different fields were added.
	\item \textbf{Document management:} Access rights can now directly be attributed when creating a document.
	\item \textbf{iOS application:} New functionality in the iOS application: It is now possible to zoom in on a document, as well as to send documents to applications and contacts.
\end{compactitem}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Release note version 2.1 (Changes to version 2.0)} \\

Document management:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item When saving a document, the user can choose whether the document is a major or a minor version.
	\item A document can now be assigned to several dossiers.
	\item Dossiers can now be locked against changes. No new documents can be added to and no documents can be removed from locked dossiers.
	\item The dossier view enables the preview of documents and removing documents from the dossier (specific versions).
	\item There are no more separate 'show' and 'edit' views for the dossiers. This has been combined with access rights to document management. The configuration over the access rights is shown.
	\item In the document view ('show' view), the location preview is now available.
	\item When saving a document entry, a new version is now created in the database only if a new document has been uploaded. If only the metadata has been modified, this is chronicled without creating a new document version. If a document is checked out then checked back in without any changes, or if an identical document is re-uploaded in the drag and drop field, no new document version will be created.
	\item Document metadata can also be modified for older document versions (e.g. useful to change the access rights or the tags / dossiers). The edit access of older document versions is only accessible via the document change log.
	\item A document can be assigned to multiple locations. 
\end{compactitem}
