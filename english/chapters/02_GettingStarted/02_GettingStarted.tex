\subsection{Obtaining access authorization / Requesting a new password}

% Die Zugangsberechtigung zum CUBE PA erhalten Sie für das Projekt Zugkunft Waldenburgerbahn beim Gesamtleiter. Senden Sie
% eine E-Mail an folgende Adresse (Zeitpunkt der Aufschaltung wird noch bekanntgegeben):

The access authorization to CUBE PA is given to you by the project manager. If you have questions about the responsibilities or the release of a CUBE PA access, send an e-mail to the following address:

\vspace{\baselineskip}

% \href{mailto:cube.support@emchberger.ch}{\textstyleInternetlink{cube.support@emchberger.ch}}
{\color{red} cube.support@emchberger.ch}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

If you have forgotten your password, you can request a new one on the login page of CUBE PA using the 'Forgot password' function. A link to reset your password will be sent to you by e-mail.If you have questions you can also contact the above e-mail address.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

For safety reasons we recommend that you immediately change passwords received by e-mail.

\subsection{Internet connection}

A functioning Internet connection is a prerequisite for using CUBE PA. Working offline is not supported, as all data is saved on a server.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

If you experience unexpected problems while using CUBE PA, check the status symbol of the connection in the lower right corner of the screen. A red symbol indicates that the Internet connection is interrupted. If this happens while you are entering data, try to restore the Internet connection, and then click 'Update' to back up the data in the local memory of CUBE PA.
If you are unable to quickly re-establish the Internet connection, do not exit CUBE ProjectAssistant or turn off the computer. Find another location where you can establish an Internet connection and as soon as you have one, click on 'Update'.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Connection status:}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\begin{tabular}{c | p{14cm} l} %{cl}

\vspace{+1pt}	
\includegraphics[height=12pt] {/Icons/online.jpg} & You have an Internet connection and you are logged in to CUBE PA. \\
\vspace{+1pt}	
\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/offline.jpg} & The Internet connection is interrupted or the CUBE PA server is temporarily unavailable. \\
\vspace{+1pt}	
\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/abgemeldet.jpg} & No status symbol is visible. You have an Internet connection but you are not logged in to CUBE PA. \\

% \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/BlaueWolke_Blitz.jpg} & Sie haben eine Internet-Verbindung, sind aber nicht in CUBE PA angemeldet \\

\end{tabular}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

If you exit CUBE PA while the Internet connection is interrupted, the data entered last will be lost.

\subsection{Starting CUBE PA}

% Benutzerspezifisch

CUBE PA can be accessed at the following address:

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Enter your username and your password. When you click on 'Log in', your personal overview appears.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note:} If your valid login details are already in the browser (e-mail address and password), you will be directly logged in to CUBE PA.

\subsection{Changing the password}
\label{bkm:Ref434828103}

For safety reasons we recommend that you immediately change any password received by e-mail. To do so, click on your name in the upper left corner of the screen. A menu appears, allowing you to log out from CUBE PA, change your password, or open or save this user manual.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-4_Passwort_aendern.jpg}}
\caption{Changing the password}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

By clicking on 'Change password' a form appears, in which you need to enter your old password once and your new password twice:

\end{figure}

As soon as you click on the 'Change password' button, the new password becomes valid.

\subsection{The most important menus, buttons and symbols briefly explained}

The CUBE PA operation is oriented towards usual Internet application operation. If you regularly use a smartphone or a tablet, you will quickly find your way in CUBE PA.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

This chapter gives an overview of the most important menus, buttons and symbols, which appear in all parts of CUBE PA and always have the same meaning.

\pagebreak

\subsubsection{Menus}

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-4_Passwort_aendern.jpg}}
\caption{The start-up menu}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}


The name of the user currently logged in to CUBE PA appears at the top left. Click on the name to display more options. The password changing option was described above (Chapter \ref{bkm:Ref434828103}). Click on 'User Manual' to open this manual as a PDF file or to save it. Click on 'Log out' to directly exit CUBE PA. If you have unsaved data, a warning appears.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/251_Browsermeldung.jpg}}
\caption{Browser warning}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}
\begin{small}
The content of this message depends on the used browser (in this case, Firefox) and therefore cannot be influenced.
\end{small}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

You can cancel exiting CUBE PA (Stay on page) and save the unsaved data by clicking on 'Update'.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\pagebreak

The main menu is located on the left:

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\begin{wrapfigure}[20]{l}{6.5cm}   % [x] Wie manche Zeile soll sich um die Grafik "brechen"
  \vspace{-35pt}      % Grundwert war 20; mit 30 schön oben beim Text ausgerichtet
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-5-1_Menu_Uebersicht.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-20pt}
  \caption{Using the menu}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

The menu enables you to choose from different fields to which you have authorized access. Depending on your authorizations, your menu may differ from this image. Menu subcategories (in this case for example 'External Meetings' under Meeting Management) may differ, as menu items can be configured specifically for a customer. The basic functions are however the same. By clicking on the menu icon \col{(1)} you can show and hide the entire menu. This gives you additional workspace in your browser when needed. \\
The designation under \col{(2)} shows you the current workspace. By clicking on the icon \col{(3)} you can directly switch between workplaces.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\begin{raggedleft}
\hspace{80mm} \includegraphics[height=40mm]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-5-1_Arbeitsumgebung_wechseln.jpg}
\end{raggedleft}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

You will only see workspaces to which you have authorization. Click on the desired workspace to go to its log in window. If you had already opened a workspace on the same day (without restarting the computer), you can return to the desired workspace without logging in. Click again on the icon \col{(3)} to close the workspace selection. 

\vspace{\baselineskip}

A central tool is the 'What would you like to do?' search filed \col{(4)}. The info-icon \col{(5)} provides useful information for a productive and effective search:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-5-1_Hilfe_zu_Suche.jpg}}
\caption{Tips for an effective search}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Click anywhere in the browser window to close the info-window. Enter the desired term/s in the search field \col{(4)}. CUBE PA searches all menu fields and entries, as well as contents of uploaded documents (for example Word and PDF documents). \\

\textbf{It is important to note} that PDF documents can only be searched if they consist of integrated text and not images. If a text is scanned and saved as an image in a PDF file, its contents will not be searched.\\

\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{7cm}   % [x] Wie manche Zeile soll sich um die Grafik "brechen"
  \vspace{-30pt}      % Grundwert war 20; mit 30 schön oben beim Text ausgerichtet
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../chapters/02_GettingStarted/pictures/2-5-1_Such_Ergebnisse.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-20pt}
  \caption{Using search results}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

All found matches are now displayed:

\begin{compactitem}
	\item Under the keyword you can find entries in actions and in documents.
	\item Hover over an entry in the actions and the details of that entry are displayed.
	\item Under other fields, in this case under documents, you can show, download, or edit a document (a meeting document in this example). To do so, hover the mouse over the desired document and click on the desired option.
\end{compactitem}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The menu item 'Dashboard' \col{(6)} always redirects you to your personal overview. When subcategories are available under a menu item, for example under 'Meeting Management', a small triangle is shown. Click on the item to display the corresponding subcategories \col{(7)}. The main item 'Meeting Management' is itself not linked. Click on it again to close the subcategories.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The main menu gives access to the different CUBE PA fields. Depending on user access authorizations, not all fields are visible and accessible for all users.

\begin{itemize}
\item
\textbf{Dashboard}: View of meetings, actions, documents and procurements which are relevant to you.
\item
\textbf{Address List}: View of the addresses with a filter function. New entries (persons and organizations) can also be made here.

\subsubsection{Warnings and tips}
If you fill in data fields in CUBE PA without clicking on 'Update' or 'Create' and decide to leave the current page, the following message appears: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{251_Browsermeldung.jpg}}
\caption{Browser warning}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}
\begin{small}
The content of this message depends on the used browser (here Firefox) and therefore cannot be influenced.
\end{small}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

You have the possibility of clicking on 'Stay on page' and then on 'Update' to back up the data. The data will otherwise be lost.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

When entering data, there are mandatory fields which must be filled out. If a mandatory field is left empty, the following message appears:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{254_WarnungPflichfelder}}

The mandatory field that must be filled out is indicated with 'This field is required' in red. The warning can be removed by clicking on 'OK'. Saving the data becomes possible after the mandatory field is filled out. 


\subsection{CUBE PA on mobile devices (Smartphones, Tablets)}

CUBE PA can also be used on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. CUBE PA recognizes that it's on a mobile device and automatically switches to the 'mobile' view. This includes a slightly different display as well as adapted menu navigation (see below). However, if you are working with tablets on which a regular Windows operating system is installed (for example, Win 8.1 / Win 10 on Microsoft Surface), the view will not be changed, and CUBE PA cannot be operated at all or only with touch inputs.
