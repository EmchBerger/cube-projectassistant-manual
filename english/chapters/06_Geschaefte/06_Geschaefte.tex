\section{Transactions}

The 'Transactions' part of CUBE PA supports the management of a structured project journal. The project journal consists of a collection of transactions which in turn are divided into subtransactions. The number of subtransactions is unlimited. A chronology for each subtransaction is available in CUBE PA. The most recent entry is displayed at the top.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The philosophy behind the transaction and subtransaction structure can be explained with the following example: You are promoted to director and mus therefore dress accordingly. The transaction 'buy business suits' can be divided into a number of subtransactions: go to color advice, market research on the most important online offers, buy suits, buy shirts, buy shoes, etc. Once all subtransactions are complete, the transaction is also complete.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

A history is recorded within each subtransaction in the form of entries. The entries basically correspond to the rows of an Excel table. The idea is to record all processes relevant to the project journal in the form of entries. CUBE PA displays the entries in chronological order, with the most recent entry at the top.

\subsection{Creating a transaction}

Mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk *.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Title \col{(1)}: Enter the name of the transaction as free text.
\item 
Status \col{(2)}: There are only the statuses 'open' and 'complete'. The first is set when creating a new transaction, and the second can be set when the transaction is complete.
\item
Summary \col{(3)}: Describe the transaction in two to three lines of free text.
\end{itemize}

Click the 'Create' button \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/B_Erstellen.jpg} \col{(4)}, and you'll have the option to upload attachments.

\caption{Uploading attachments}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Uploading attachments is mainly intended to avoid entering long explanations. You therefore have the option to refer to an attachment.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

To add an attachment, click on the plus sign \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pluszeichen.jpg} \col{(1)}. The fields for uploading an attachment appear:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Title \col{(2)}: Give an suitable name for the attachment.
\item
To upload a document, click on the 'Search' button \col{(3)} and double click on the desired document. If you uploaded the wrong file, simply upload a new one.
\item
Then click on the 'Apply' button \col{(4)} and the attachment is added.
\end{itemize}


You can add as many attachments as needed by clicking on the plus sign \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pluszeichen.jpg} \col{(5)}. You can change the order of the attachments by dragging the symbol with vertical opposing arrows \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/VertPfeile.jpg} \col{(6)} and dropping it at the desired position. Clicking on the garbage bin symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Muelltonne.jpg} \col{(7)} removes an attachment.

\subsection{Creating a subtransaction}

You can either go to the same screen as when adding attachments to a transaction, or you can go back to the menu and select the 'Transactions' item. In the list of transactions you can select the transaction for which you want to create a subtransaction.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

You can now search optically within the entire list of transactions or filter through the list. To search through the list of transactions simply scroll down to the pagination. You can switch pages by clicking on the page numbers or using the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/SeitenBlaettern.jpg}
\end{center}

You can use the search fields to filter through the list or a separate field for a full text search \col{(1)}. In the 'Title' field \col{(2)} you can enter free text. For the 'Project/Subproject' field \col{(3)} and the 'Status' field \col{(4)} there's a selection list. Once you have selected the filter values, click on the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} \col{(5)} on the left (or hit 'Enter') and the filtered list appears. Alternatively, you can use the full text search to search for keywords in the list. Click on the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} \col{(5)} or hit 'Enter' to start the search.

\end{figure}

When you find the relevant transaction, click on the blue title text of the transaction \col{(6)}. The form with an overview of the transaction appears.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{62_GeschaefteUebersicht.jpg}}
\caption{Overview of the transactions}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Below the title, the status, the summary and the attachments you will find a plus sign \includegraphics[height=12pt]{62_TeilgeschaeftErfassen.jpg} \col{(1)} with which you can create a new subtransaction. Existing subtransactions are shown below it \col{(2)}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Click on 'Create new subtransaction' and a window is opened in which you can enter the information about the subtransaction.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{62_NeuesTeilgeschaeftErfassen.jpg}}
\caption{Creating a new subtransaction}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Enter the required information in the fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item
'Title' \col{(1)} allows the input of free text.
\item
'Status' \col{(2)} is automatically set to 'open'. When the subtransaction is complete, you can set the status to 'complete'.
\item
The 'Project/Subproject' field \col{(3)} contains a selection list from which you can link the subtransaction to a project or a subproject. The transaction to which the subtransaction is subordinated inherits this link. It is shown in the list of the transaction. The transaction inherits the sum of all (sub)projects assigned to its subordinate subtransactions.
\end{itemize}

Click on the 'Create' button \col{(4)} to save the subtransaction. The title of the subtransaction only appears in the pink rectangle in the overview of the transaction. You now have the possibility to either add an entry to the new subtransaction or to add another subtransaction. If you enter more than one subtransaction, the latest one appears at the top in the overview.

\subsection{Accessing the overview of a transaction}

If you want to have a complete overview of a transaction, select the 'Transactions' menu item. In the list of transactions, look for the transaction whose overview you need.

% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Fill out the fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item
'Details' \col{(1)} is a free text field for describing an entry, e.g. the description of a process.
\item
'Processed by' \col{(2)} is a free text field for entering who will process the task described in the entry.
\item
'Due date' \col{(3)} should be filled out in date format DD.MM.YYYY. This allows you to specify when the task described in the entry is to be completed.
\item
If the entry only describes a statement for example, the 'Processed by' and 'Due date' fields don't need to be filled.
\end{itemize}

Click on the 'Create' button \col{(4)} and the entry appears in the overview of the subtransaction.

\begin{figure}[H]
