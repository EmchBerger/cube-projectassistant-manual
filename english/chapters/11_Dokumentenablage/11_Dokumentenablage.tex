  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

Select the 'Document Management' menu item in the main menu on the left. The subcategories 'Documents' and 'Dossiers' appear.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The document management function is used to manage documents and to edit them. When documents or their metadata are edited, they receive a new version number in CUBE PA. On one hand, the check-out and check-in functions guarantee that a document is only edited by one user at once. On the other hand, the versioning of documents ensures that all project participants can refer to unique document versions.

\vspace{1cm}  

Entered or uploaded documents can be sorted into dossiers, which can then easily be downloaded. For this reason, creating and handling a dossier are described first in the tutorial.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Document management will then be explained in detail.

\subsection{Dossiers}
\label{bkm:Ref442544219}\subsubsection{Creating dossiers}

A dossier is a set of related documents. A classic example is a planning approval dossier or a preliminary project. Dossiers enable the grouping together of several uploaded documents, so that they can later be downloaded together in a ZIP archive.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-1-1_UebersichtDossiers.jpg}}
\caption{Creating a new dossier}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

To create a new dossier, select the 'Document Management' menu item in the menu on the left then click on 'Dossiers'. Then click on the plus symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Plussymbol.jpg} \col{(1)}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The input form for dossiers appears:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-1-1_DossierEingabemaske.jpg}}
\caption{Input form for a new dossier}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Enter the new dossier's title \col{(2)}. Since more than one dossier can revolve around the same theme, it makes sense to add a date indication in the title, e.g. 'XY Feasibility Study. August 2015'. It is also advisable to first check, before creating a dossier, if a dossier with a similar title already exists. In this case, the exact same text should be used in the title, e.g. 'XY Feasibility Study. August 2015' and 'XY Feasibility Study. December 2015'. If necessary, a detailed description \col{(3)} can be added. Dossiers can be locked against changes. If this function is activated, documents can no longer be added to or removed from the dossier. To do so, check the 'Locked' check-box \col{(4)}. The dossier is now no longer available for selection in the drop-down menu of documents. If needed, dossiers can be protected by access rights. If no special access rights are needed, keep the 'Use default access rights' check-box \col{(5)} checked. If the dossier should only be accessible for certain user groups / users, remove the check-mark. You can later specify which user(s) or which group(s) can view the dossier. For information about access rights, see chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442273510}. \newline

When all desired information is entered, the dossier is created by clicking on the 'Create' button \col{(6)}. To go back to the overview / list of all dossiers, click on the list symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Listensymbol_zurueck.jpg} \col{(1)}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

When a dossier is created with the 'Create' button, the following view appears:

\begin{figure}[H]

% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

The dossier entry is now visible. Click on the ZIP symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/ZIPSymbol.jpg} \col{(2)} to download the documents contained in this dossier. You will also see a list of all the documents contained in this dossier. Click in the blue document title \col{(3)} to open the options (see option explanations below). It is specified which of the major or minor versions of the document is linked to the dossier. Click again on the blue document title to close the options.

Click on the list symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Listensymbol_zurueck.jpg} \col{(1)} to go back to the overview.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The assignment of documents to dossiers can be made under the 'Documents' menu item (a subcategory of the 'Document Management' menu item in the menu on the left). To add documents to a dossier, the documents must first be uploaded (see chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442769978}).

\subsubsection{Viewing and editing dossiers}

The following options are available in the dossier overview:

\end{figure}

You can hide and show columns with the configuration symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/SpaltenEinst.jpg} \col{(1)} (This can't be changed in the dossier overview since there's only one column). By clicking on 'Title' \col{(2)}, the dossiers are sorted from A to Z. With another click, they are sorted from Z to A.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Search:} You can search for dossiers in the overview. Without using a placeholder (*), you can directly enter a keyword and click on the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} \col{(3)} or hit 'Enter'. All dossiers containing the keyword will be listed. \newline

By clicking on the dossier title \col{(4)} you switch directly to the detailed and editing view of the dossier. In the overview you can also see how many documents are linked to a dossier  \col{(5)}. Deleting dossiers is not possible at the moment. \newline

If you open a dossier by clicking on its title \col{(4)}, you can also see next to its title and description all the documents contained in the dossier:

\end{figure}

The magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe.jpg} \col{(c)} directs you to the document entry. You can change the document entry, upload a new document version, etc. For details on document management, see chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442273482}. The download symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Download.jpg} \col{(b)} enables you to download a specific document version (that is not the entire dossier). Depending on the document type, you have the possibility to preview a specific document online. If this option is available, a right-pointing arrow \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil_rechts.jpg} \col{(a)} is displayed. Clicking on the arrow opens the preview in a small window. Clicking again on the now downwards-pointing arrow closes the preview.

At the top left, the document navigation shows how many pages the document contains and enables you to browse through the document pages with the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons \col{(1)}. If needed (for example for a map or a plan) you can use the '90°'-Symbol to rotate a page - another click rotates the page a further 90°, etc. The preview can be closed with the 'X' button \col{(3)}.

\vspace{5cm}

\subsubsection{Dossier access rights}
\label{bkm:Ref442273510}
For every dossier, you can specify who can read, edit, and/or delete it (deleting dossiers is not possible at the moment). You can assign access rights to one or more group(s) or user(s). The procedure is described in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442869495} and is similar to setting access rights for documents.

To upload new documents, click on the plus symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Plussymbol.jpg} \col{(1)}. More information is provided in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442770648}. The filter symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Filter.jpg} \col{(2)} allows you to show or hide the advanced filter functions (see below 'Advanced filter' (\ref{bkm:Ref201704051})). The pin symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Nadelsymbol.jpg} (toggle map) \col{(3)} allows you to show or hide Google Maps. On the map, all documents related to the search query and linked to Google Maps are shown. The full text search \col{(4)} searches the entries according to keywords. After entering the keyword, click on the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} \col{(5)} or hit 'Enter'. More than one keyword can be used. If you are searching for a particular word group, enter the word between quotation marks. With the full text search, the titles of documents and dossiers, the tags, and if technically possible, the document contents are searched. Under the full text search, you can see how many data entries were found \col{(6)}.\\
The configuration symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/SpaltenEinst.jpg} \col{(7)} enables you to hide unused columns. After selecting the desired columns click 'Apply' and the view will be updated.\newline
  \newline
In addition to the full text search, you can search in the blue headings \col{(8)}, or use the drop-down menus to choose which documents should be displayed. Clicking on the blue headings sorts the entries from A to Z by this column content. Clicking again sorts them from Z to A. \newline
Uploaded documents can be labeled with tags \col{(9)}. More information about tags is provided in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442275849}. \\
The check boxes \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/selectbox.jpg} \col{(10)} allow you to select documents (one or many) to apply actions like 'Download', 'Send as Email attachment', and 'Send in print format' to the selection. For further information, see chapter \ref{bkm:Ref201705445} (Document cart).

Clicking on a listed data entry \col{(11)} (in the title column, blue text), shows further options. Another click hides the options. The options are explained below.

Click on the gray plus symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/plus_grau.jpg} \col{(a)} and select the desired file or files. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the desired file or files over the 'plus area'. Once a file has been selected / dropped in the 'plus area', additional fields \col{(b-d)} appear. If you're uploading a big file, you can see the upload progress of the file \col{(d)} and see if the file was completely uploaded. The title field is a mandatory field. It is copied from the file name field \col{(c)} but can be changed at any time. If you've uploaded the wrong file, click on the small cross \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Kreuzchen.jpg} \col{(b)} to remove the file / entry. \\
You can add additional files. To do so, repeat the above steps.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

In the description \col{(4)}, you can enter additional notes. Under authors \col{(5)}, you can use a drop-down menu to select the authors. An author must already exist. If an author is not on the list, they can be added by the administrator. You have the option to enter a document date \col{(6)}. To assign a document to a dossier (see chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442544219}), select the dossier from the drop-down menu \col{(7)} (the dossier must already exist). A document can be assigned to more than one dossier. Click again on the drop-down menu to select more dossiers for the document. 'Tags' \col{(8)} can be defined and then assigned to a document. It is then possible to search for specific tags to find documents of specific projects, project phases, areas of expertise, or document types. Tag themes (e.g. area of expertise) as well as individual tags (e.g. level crossings, lighting, operation, etc.) can only be defined or added by the administrator. If a tag is missing, please contact the administrator. \newline

In case of a multiple file upload, a separate entry, but with the same information (description, authors, dossier, etc.) is created for each uploaded document. This is a time-saving procedure, especially for the compilation of a dossier with many documents having the same description, authors, etc. \newline

%If a document is no longer valid, it can be excluded from search results by checking the 'Revoked' check-box \col{(8)}. This function is not to be confused with the versioning of documents, whereby old versions of a document are not displayed in search results by default. \newline

You can define whether a newly uploaded file is a major version (V2, V3, etc.) or a minor version (V3.1, V3.2, etc.) of a document. If the new document is a major version check the 'Major version' check-box \col{(9)}. You can assign standard access rights to a document \col{(10)} or only authorize its access to specific persons. Access rights can be adapted and expanded any time later in the edit mode. Refer to chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442869495} for more information about access rights. In order to create a document, at least one person must have access rights to the documents (usually the person creating the document).

Once all necessary information is entered, the document is uploaded with the 'Create' button \col{(11)} and the entries are saved. \newline

\textbf{Note:} A document can only be replaced by one other document. When attempting to drag several documents into the upload window, the following error message appears:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{1122_FehlerDokumentErsetzen.jpg}}
\caption{Error message for uploading more than one file}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Note:} If only the metadata of a document is modified and saved, no new document version will be created. The changes in the metadata will however appear in the document change log. Similarly, if the same file is uploaded (in which no changes were made) or if a document was checked-out then checked-in without any changes being made, CUBE PA does not create a new document version. The following message appears:

\begin{figure}[H]

In order to continue working, you must first click 'OK' in the above dialog.

\subsubsection{Linking document with Google Maps}
\label{bkm:Ref442545553}
Documents can be linked to Google Maps. This way documents related to a specific location can be found, edited or downloaded. \\
Switch to the edit mode of the desired document with the editing symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Bearbeiten.jpg} (in the view mode, you can only view Google Maps links but you can't create, add or remove a link).

Click on the arrow symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil_rechts.jpg} \col{(3)} to preview the document in the document overview - insofar as the preview of the uploaded file format is supported. Click again on the arrow symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil_unten.jpg} to close the preview. More information about the preview is given later. \newline

You can also download the document directly \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/download.jpg} \col{(4)}, view the document entry \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe.jpg} \col{(5)} or edit the document entry \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Bearbeiten.jpg} \col{(6)}. \newline

To edit a document online, it must be checked out with the symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Auschecken.jpg} \col{(7)}. The procedure is described in detail in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442776572}.

\subsubsection{Document cart}
\label{bkm:Ref201705445}
% Neues Kapitel

The document cart's functionality is similar to that of a shopping cart in an online shop. The document cart enables different functions such as downloading documents in a zip file, sending them directly in an email, or sending plans to be plotted. It is therefore possible to add a certain number of documents to the document cart and then use the desired function on all the documents in the cart.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Proceed as follows:

Plans can be sent directly from the document list to a plot center for direct delivery of plotted plans. Several plans can be sent to different recipients within one order. The execution is carried out separately for each recipient (number of copies, printed/electronic versions).

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Proceed as follows to send plans via plot centers: As described above, select all required documents / plans and add them to the document cart. You can now see all selected documents in the document cart. You can remove documents you don't need from the cart by clicking the cross symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/blKreuzchen.jpg}. When all documents / plans are selected, click on the printer symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/printer.jpg} in the document cart. The following window appears:

\textbf{Project:} This is a mandatory field. Select the corresponding project from the predefined list of projects. \\
\textbf{Subproject / Object:} This is a free text field for additional project information. \\
\textbf{Plot center:} This is a mandatory field. All plot centers defined in the default settings (configuration) can be selected here for the plan delivery. \\
\textbf{Priority:} This is a mandatory field. You can choose between three priority levels:

You should take into account that the delivery depends on the time the order was placed. For more details, contact the responsible bodies. \\
\textbf{Due date:} This is a mandatory field. The delivery date is set automatically depending on the priority level of the order and can subsequently be changed. \\
\textbf{Goal:} You can select one or more goals from a defined list. These will appear on the delivery slip of the recipients.
\begin{figure}[H]

\textbf{Message to recipients:} This is a free text field where you can enter necessary information for the receiver or receivers. \\
\textbf{Message to plot center:} This message will be visible for the plot center after the order is placed. \\
\textbf{Attachments:} You can add specifications for each document of the document cart that is now set for plan delivery. Click on the blue document / plan title to open it or save it on your computer.
In general, the size plan format is set based on the PDF file. You can however still change that and ask the plot center for a different format. In addition, you can specify if you want the plans to be printed in black and white or in color. You can also specify the finishing of the printed documents to be delivered to the site or to an office.
Once you've entered all the necessary parameters, click on 'Continue to page 2' to enter the recipient details:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-dkorb_ReproDialog2.jpg}}
\caption{'Recipient details' dialog for plan delivery}
% \label{fig:speciation}

In this dialog you can select one or more recipients for the plan delivery. Proceed as follows: Select the desired person from the 'Add recipients' drop-down list. After making the selection, click on the plus symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Plussymbol.jpg} \col{(1)}. Repeat this step until you've added all the recipients you want to deliver the plans to. Once you click on the plus symbol, the person is added at the bottom of the dialog window. You can now set additional specifications, such as the number of copies needed per recipient and if the recipient should receive a hard copy (Printed) and / or a soft copy by email (Electronic).

\vspace{\baselineskip}

If you need to make changes to or simply check the 'General Information' you've entered, you can click on 'Go back to page 1'. Once you're sure of your order, click on 'Send order'. The delivery slip is shown and the corresponding emails are sent. The plot center receives the order by email with a link to CUBE PA to be able to carry out the order. Once the plot center carries out the order, the order is marked as 'complete' by the repro center and the person who placed the order is informed.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Once the order is placed, this is shown in the personal overview of the person (CUBE PA user) who placed it. Similarly, once the plot center marks the order as 'complete', this is also shown in the personal overview.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Important notice:} If you click on the cross symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/X_BUtton.jpg} (top right) of the plan delivery dialog while entering details, you loose all specifications / entries. The documents / plans remain in the document cart and you can begin again with a new order.

\subsubsection{Document access rights}
\label{bkm:Ref442869495}

You can set for each document who can read, edit and/or delete the document (deleting documents is not possible in the current version). You can assign access rights for one or more groups or one or more users:

You have the option to assign standard access rights to the document. To do so, check the 'Use default access rights' box \col{(1)}. If you use the default access rights settings, you (among others) get full access to the document you created. In addition, predefined groups will also get rights to the documents. (In the user management, groups can be defined, for which document access rights are automatically assigned when the 'Use default access rights' box is checked. These settings are defined by the poweruser.)

You can change the access rights at anytime. The plus sign \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pluszeichen.jpg} \col{(1)} enables you to add more groups / persons and to define the access rights as described above: Select a group that can view / edit the document (the group must already exist) or select a person. Click on the small arrow \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Dropdown.jpg} next to 'Please select' or the name. A drop-down menu appears from which you can select the desired group / person. Under 'Access' \col{(2)}, choose the rights of the selected group / person: read / edit / delete.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

You can also add or remove access rights to existing groups / persons \col{(2)}. To remove the existing access rights, click on the garbage bin symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Muelltonne.jpg} \col{(3)} and confirm the security warning 'Remove?' with 'OK'.  \newline

Once you've made the necessary changes, click on 'Apply'. 

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note:} For the first person / group (in general the person creating the document in CUBE PA), all access rights are automatically checked. For each additional group / person, only the read access rights are automatically checked. This can be changed at any time.


\subsubsection{Editing documents online / Checking-out and checking-in documents}

In the document overview, click on the blue title of the desired document \col{(1)}. The options appear. Click on the 'check-out' symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Auschecken.jpg} \col{(4)}. Alternatively, you can do this in the view mode of the document (accessible via the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe.jpg} \col{(3)} in the overview). The document will be checked-out, opened, and locked for editing by other users. Now you can directly work in the document.

\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{6cm}
\vspace{-15pt}
\includegraphics[height=30mm]{1127_WordSpeichern.jpg}
% \caption{Status ändern}
\end{wrapfigure}
To stop the editing, save the document with the corresponding symbol \col{(1)} (here Office 2013 -- top left) in the MS Office program or with the 'Ctrl+S' shortcut. The updated document will directly be saved on the server. To continue editing the document at a later time, click the symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Wolke_blauklein.jpg} \col{(2)} (open the checked-out document) in the document overview or in the view mode of the document you want to edit.

Once you've finished editing and you've saved the document, you can check-in the document 
by clicking the check-in symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Einchecken.jpg} \col{(3)} in the document overview or in the view mode of the document. The last saved file on the server is automatically set as the latest version in the document management. The symbols for opening checked-out documents and for checking-in documents are only visible for checked-out documents.

\caption{Checking-in a document}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

As an alternative for editing documents online, you can also work 'offline'. To do so, check-out the document as described above. Then save the document locally on your hard disk using 'Save as' in the MS Office program. To upload the document once again, you need to first check-in the document (see above). 
The last saved document on the server will be uploaded. Since in the meantime, you've made changes to the document locally, then you must also upload your locally saved file. This can be done in the editing mode of the document (see chapters \ref{bkm:Ref442801819} and \ref{bkm:Ref443047930}). \newline

If you want to work 'offline', it is not necessary to first check-out the document and then check it back in after making the changes. You can also download a document, save it locally, edit it, and then upload it again (new version, see chapters \ref{bkm:Ref442801819} and \ref{bkm:Ref443047930}). However, the check-out/check-in procedure ensures that a document is not edited by multiple users at the same time.

\textbf{Tip}: A document that you have checked-out will appear automatically in your personal project overview. You can directly open the document for further editing or check it back in. \newline

%\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note}: The online editing of documents can be done with the usual MS Office programs. Documents in other formats (e.g. PDF or CAD plans) can also be checked-out, but editing them online is not possible. The editing of such documents can only be done offline. \newline

% \vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note}: A checked-out document is locked for editing by other users. The symbols for editing and checking-out the document will not be accessible and a red warning symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Warnung_rot.jpg} \col{(1)} will appear in their place. In the 'Checkout file (latest version)' field in the view mode of the document, a message states that the document is currently checked-out \col{(2)}.

\subsubsection{Searching by tags}
\label{bkm:Ref442275849}

Tags can be defined for every document. It is then possible to search for specific tags to find documents of specific projects, project phases, areas of expertise, or document types. There are different tag themes (e.g. area of expertise, project phase) and in these categories, individual tags (e.g. level crossings, lighting, operation etc.). The assignment of a tag to a category is described in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref442863508}.

% \caption{Status ändern}
\end{wrapfigure}
To search for documents with tags, proceed as follows:
In the menu on the left, select the 'Document Management' menu item and the subcategory 'Documents'. In the overview, the entered / uploaded documents are listed \col{(1)}. In the 'Tags' column, click in the search field \col{(2)}. You can choose the desired tags by entering manually in the field or by searching an picking them from the drop-down menu \col{(3)}.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\vspace{-30pt}
\includegraphics[height=50mm]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-2-8_TagEingabe.jpg}
% \caption{Status ändern}
\end{wrapfigure}
You can simultaneously select more than one tag for one search query. To do so click on the right of the first tag entry \col{(4)} in the search field \col{(5)} (it will be set in a gray field). After entering the tags, click on the magnifying glass symbol (at the left of the filter fields \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} \col{(6)} or hit 'Enter'. All documents that were assigned one or more of the selected tags will be listed.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\subsubsection{Advanced search}

To only display documents that were assigned all the selected tags, follow the steps below: 

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-2-8_TagsFiltern.jpg}}
\caption{Connecting tags with 'AND' / 'OR'}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Under the 'Tags' column entry field, click on the arrow symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil_rechts.jpg} \col{(1)} to display the advanced search window. In the 'link' field \col{(2)}, select the value 'AND' \col{(3)} using the drop-down menu. Then click on the magnifying glass symbol (left of the filter fields) \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe.jpg} \col{(4)}  or hit 'Enter' and only the documents that were assigned all the tags will be displayed. The value 'OR' is selected by default, that is only one of the tags needs to match the query. \newline

To exclude certain tags from the search, select these tags in the 'exclude' entry field \col{(5)}. You can select more than one tag. Click on the magnifying glass symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Lupe_kl.jpg} and only the documents that are not assigned these tags will be displayed. The 'link' and 'exclude' advanced search functions can also be combined.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Click on the arrow symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil_unten.jpg} \col{(6)} to hide the advanced search window.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note}: In the tags search field, you can only search for previously defined tags. Click on the question mark symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Fragezeichen.jpg} next to the 'Tags' column title and a window appears with a list of tag categories from which tags can be selected. To search for terms that are not defined as tags, use the full text search.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The advanced search function also works with dossiers. The 'link' ('AND'/'OR') and 'exclude' functions are identical to the 'link' and 'exclude' advanced search functions for tags.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical tagging: Document search via 'folder structure'}
% Neues Kapitel

In addition to finding documents through tags, it is possible to set up a 'folder structure' and to place uploaded documents within this 'folder structure'. This allows you an optimal and combined usage of the advantages of both management options: 'tagging' and 'folders'. Documents can be found through one or more tags as well as by navigating the hierarchical structure. The same document can be placed in several 'hierarchy trees' at a time.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\textbf{Note:} Creating the folder structure is explained in the Configuration chapter. It should be noted that special rights are needed for the configuration. In addition, a few points should also be taken into account when creating the structure. The preparation of a folder structure is crucial for a smooth future implementation. In case of questions, contact your poweruser or your CUBE PA consultant at Emch+Berger AG Bern.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

By navigating the folder structure, the corresponding tags are automatically set in the 'Tag' filter:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-htag_Start.jpg}}
\caption{Using the folder structure}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Once a folder structure is set up, a tile with the structure title appears as in the above picture under \col{(1)}. This folder structure is called 'Reference sheet. The name can be freely chosen. In addition, it is also possible to set up multiple folder structures. Clicking on the title displays the next level of the folder structure \col{(1)}:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-htag_Nav.jpg}}
\caption{Navigating the folder structure}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

Click on 'Railway systems' \col{(1)} to go to the next level / selection. Under 'Railway systems', the folders 'Field of expertise' and 'Country' are found among others. Select 'Rail operation' \col{(2)} in this level to keep going deeper into the folder structure. Under 'Rail operation' you'll find the folder 'Services' and its corresponding tags. Choose for example the tag 'Site logistics' \col{(3)} to see the results of your search below. While you were navigating the tag structure, the corresponding tags were automatically filled out in the filter:

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{../chapters/11_Dokumentenablage/pictures/11-htag_Tags.jpg}}
\caption{Result in filter}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

The tags you selected above were passed to the filter \col{(1)}. You can still remove individual tags or all the tags by clicking on the cross symbol. The new search with adapted filter will be carried out once you click on the magnifying glass symbol \col{(2)}. Click on the folder symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Ordner.jpg} \col{(2)} to open the current folder structure in an overview: 

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Folder structure in the overview}
% \label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

You can now navigate the overview. You can close open folders \col{(1)} and open other folders \col{(2)}. Click on the blue arrow \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Pfeil-rechts.jpg} \col{(3)} to fill the filter with the corresponding tags. To close the overview window, click on the cross symbol \includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/x_Button.jpg} \col{(4)}.

\subsubsection{Symbol legend in document management}

Symbols valid all over CUBE PA are listed in chapter \ref{bkm:Ref443039356}. The following symbols are used in document management:

\begin{tabular}{|c|p{14cm}|} %{cl}
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Nadelsymbol.jpg}} & The pin indicates the presence of a document linked to a location in Google Maps. Hover the mouse over the pin and the document name is displayed. The document can be repositioned in the map by right-clicking on the pin and moving it in the map. Clicking on the needle symbol in Google Maps in the document overview automatically opens the map and shows the position of the document with a pin needle. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Stecknadel.jpg}} & The pin needle shows the fixed position of a document with the the option to directly download the document from the map or to view the details of the documents. A preview of the document is also an option. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Auschecken.jpg}} & Cloud with downward-pointing arrow: Clicking on this symbol checks out the corresponding document. At the same time, the document is opened and locked for editing by other users. If a document is already checked-out, this symbol is not displayed. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Wolke_blauklein.jpg}} & Cloud (without arrow): Clicking on this symbol opens the corresponding document that you have previously checked-out. The symbol only appears for documents that you have checked out. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Einchecken.jpg}} & Cloud with upward-pointing arrow: Clicking on this symbol checks the corresponding document back in. The last saved version in the server is set in document management. The symbol only appears for documents that you have checked out. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Warnung_rot.jpg}} & Red warning symbol: This symbol appears for documents that have been checked out by other users and that are locked for editing. This symbol is shown in the document overview. In the view mode of a document (accessible via the magnifying glass symbol), you can see who has checked out the document and thus locked it. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Download.jpg}} & Downward-pointing arrow: Click on this symbol to download the corresponding document. This symbol / function is not to be confused with document check-out. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Favoritenmarken.jpg}} & Favorite mark: Clicking on the fray symbol adds the corresponding document to your personal favorites and displays it in your personal overview. If a document has already been added to your favorites, the symbol is red. Clicking on the red symbol removes the document from your favorites. \\
\hline
\raisebox{-1\totalheight}{\includegraphics[height=12pt]{/Icons/Fragezeichen.jpg}} & Question mark: This symbol is displayed in the document overview at the right of the 'Tags' column title. Clicking on it shows from which tag categories tags can be selected for the search query. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
